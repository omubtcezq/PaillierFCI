\begin{abstract}
    State estimate fusion is a common requirement in distributed sensor networks and can be complicated by untrusted participants or network eavesdroppers. We present a method for computing the common Fast Covariance Intersection fusion algorithm on an untrusted cloud without disclosing individual estimates or the fused result. In an existing solution to this problem, fusion weights corresponding to the sensor estimate errors are leaked to the cloud in order to perform the fusion. In this work, we present a method that guarantees no leakage at the cloud by requiring an additional computation step by the party querying the cloud for the fused result. The Paillier encryption scheme is used to homomorphically compute seperate parts of the computation that can be combined after decryption. This encrypted Fast Covariance Intersection algorithm can be used in scenarios where the fusing cloud is not trusted and relative sensor performances must remain confidential.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Data fusion and distributed state estimation have long been active fields of research and continue to find many applications in modern systems today \cite{andersonOptimalFiltering1979,simonOptimalStateEstimation2006}. Methods relying on the Kalman filter and derivatives \cite{haugBayesianEstimationTracking2012} have become particularly prevalent in this area due to their recursive structure and suitability to modelling estimate cross-correlations typically required for data fusion \cite{mutambaraDecentralizedEstimationControl1998,ligginsDistributedDataFusion2012}. The handling of these cross-correlations is especially important when consistent or optimal fusion is desired \cite{bar-shalomTracktotrackCorrelationProblem1981,sunMultisensorOptimalInformation2004} and presents a key challenge in data fusion when they are not known in advance. To overcome this, some methods propagate cross-correlations through time at the cost of repeated reconstruction \cite{steinbringOptimalSamplebasedFusion2016} and typically add local computational complexity. Alternative methods approximate error cross-correlations with conservative suboptimal estimates to provide consistent fusion instead \cite{julierNondivergentEstimationAlgorithm1997,noackDecentralizedDataFusion2017,niehsenInformationFusionBased2002}. One such popular method is Covariance Intersection \cite{julierNondivergentEstimationAlgorithm1997} and it computationally inexpensive approximation, Fast Covariance Intersection \cite{niehsenInformationFusionBased2002}. These methods minimise fusion estimate error given possible conservative estimates and are popular due to their compatibility with the information form of the Kalman filter \cite{mutambaraDecentralizedEstimationControl1998,pfaffInformationFormDistributed2017}.

While effective and often efficient, these data fusion solutions have traditionally been performed on closed networks with trusted participants and inherently imply a trust between sensors and estimators. In recent years, the ubiquity of distributed public networks has seen the additional challenges of security and privacy become increasingly relevant in distributed sensing environments and has led to an active field of reserach in providing security during data processing and fusion tasks \cite{renSecurityChallengesPublic2012,brennerSecretProgramExecution2011}. While ensuring transimitted information is kept secret from eavesdroppers on untrusted networks is achievable with common private and public key encryption schemes \cite{katzIntroductionModernCryptography2008}, tasks involving untrusted participants during computations present a greater challenge. Here, partial computations on encrypted data or the leakage of intermediate results are often required for arriving at the final result \cite{risticSecureFastCovariance2021,shiPrivacyPreservingAggregationTimeSeries2011}. One common tool for achieving these requirements is homomorphic encryption \cite{gentryFullyHomomorphicEncryption2009,paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999} which allows operations to be computed on encrypted numbers without decryption. The Pailler encryption scheme \cite{paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999} allows homomorphic addition and is a frequent choice in fusion application due to its applicability, simplicity and provable security. In \cite{alanwarPrOLocResilientLocalization2017}, the Paillier scheme is used to perform non-Bayesian measurement fusion with range-sensors without disclosing individual sensor locations or measurements, while in \cite{aristovEncryptedMultisensorInformation2018}, it is used in to achieve similar security with a Kalman filter when measurements are linear and sensors form a heirarchical network. When paired with additional schemes that introduce some leakage, tasks in a wider variety of scenarios can often be solved as well. \cite{alexandruEncryptedCooperativeControl2019} uses private weighted sum aggregation together with the Paillier scheme to compute decentralised local control inputs while leaking only the sum of weighted neightbouring states, while in \cite{risticSecureFastCovariance2021}, an untrusted cloud can use order-revealing encryptions to compute and leak relative sensor accuracies allowing the homomorphic computation of the Covariance Intersection fusion algorithm.

In this work, we consider stochastic state estimate fusion on an untrusted cloud similar to \cite{risticSecureFastCovariance2021}, but aim to fuse estimates with no leakage at the cloud. Our contribution is a novel method for computing the Fast Covariance Intersection algorithm using only the Paillier encryption scheme and leaking no intermediate information to the untrsuted cloud. While in some use-cases, leaked relative sensor accuracies can be useful for prioritising sensor communications, this leakage inherently informs the cloud about sensor performances over time, disclosing the times when sensors are out of range or non-functioning and implicitly leaking information about the fused estimate. Therefore, the presented method finds application when all sensor information is considered sensitive and when the fusing cloud is not trusted.

Section~\ref{sec:problem} introduces the formal data fusion and security goals and section~\ref{sec:prelims} gives relevant preliminaries. Section~\ref{sec:encrypted_fci} introduces our method, before sections~\ref{sec:security} and \ref{sec:simulation} analyse its security and simulation results, respectively. Concluding remarks and future work are discussed in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\subsection{Notation}
Throughout this work, the following notation is used. Plain characters, $a$, denote scalars, underlined lowercase characters, $\vec{b}$, denote vectors and uppercase bold characters, $\mat{C}$, denote matrices. $\mat{C}^{-1}$ denotes the matrix inverse and $\tr(\mat{C})$ the matrix trace. Encryption with a public key $\mathsf{pk}$ is denoted $\mathcal{E}_{\mathsf{pk}}(\cdot)$ and decryption with a private key $\mathsf{sk}$ is denoted $\mathcal{D}_{\mathsf{sk}}(\cdot)$, while encoding and decoding with parameters $M$ and $\phi$ are denoted $\mathsf{E}_{M,\phi}(\cdot)$ and $\mathsf{E}^{-1}_{M,\phi}(\cdot)$, respectively. All encryption and encoding operations on vectors or matrices are performed elementwise and the expression $\otimes_{i=1}^{m}\mat{C}_i$ is used to denote elementwise multiplication for multidimensional data.

\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem}
In this work, we consider an arbitrary time-varying process defined by its state $\vec{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for all timesteps $k \in \mathbb{N}$. This process is estimated by $m$ individual estimators $i$, $1\leq i\leq m$, each producing a state estimate and an estimate error covariance,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ests_and_covs}
    \hat{\vec{x}}_{k,i} \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ and } \mat{P}_{k,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\,,
\end{equation}
respectively, at every timestep $k$. Our aim at every timestep is for all estimates $\hat{\vec{x}}_{k,i}$ and errors $\mat{P}_{k,i}$, $1\leq i\leq m$, to be sent to a cloud server where a fused estimate and error covariance,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fus_ests_and_covs}
    \hat{\vec{x}}_{k,\mathsf{fus}} \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ and } \mat{P}_{k,\mathsf{fus}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\,,
\end{equation}
respectively, are computed and are consistent with the estimates in \eqref{eqn:ests_and_covs}.

Simulataneously, we consider the desired security of the fusion process. The fusing cloud and estimators are treated as \textit{honest-but-curious}, that is, they follow protocols correctly but may use learned information for malicious gain, and a trusted third party exists that can query the cloud at any timestep $k$ to obtain the fusion results in \eqref{eqn:fus_ests_and_covs}. We aim for the cloud, estimators and eavesdroppers to learn no additional information from observed estimates and fusions, \eqref{eqn:ests_and_covs} and \eqref{eqn:fus_ests_and_covs}, respectively, beyond their local estimates. To guarantee this, cryptographic \textit{Indistinguishability under the Chosen Plaintext Attack} (IND-CPA) \cite{katzIntroductionModernCryptography2008} is desired for all transimitted and processed information. This is inline with common security goals in the field and suitable for homomorphic encryption.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:prelims}
When proposing our solution in section~\ref{sec:encrypted_fci}, we make use of the Fast Covariance Intersection algorithm, the Paillier homomorphic encryption scheme and a common integer encoding for floating-point numbers. These preliminaries are summarised below.

\subsection{Fast Covariance Intersection}\label{subsec:fci}
The Fast Covariance Intersection (FCI) algorithm \cite{niehsenInformationFusionBased2002} provides a consistent suboptimal fusion of estimates in the form \eqref{eqn:ests_and_covs} when cross-correlations between the measurements are not known, providing a fast, non-iterative and general solution. Fusion is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ci_cov_fusion}
    \mat{P}_{k,\mathsf{fus}} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^m\omega_{k,i}\mat{P}_{k,i}^{-1}\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ci_est_fusion}
    \hat{\vec{x}}_{k,\mathsf{fus}} = \mat{P}_{k,\mathsf{fus}}\sum_{i=1}^m\omega_{k,i}\mat{P}_{k,i}^{-1}\hat{\vec{x}}_{k,i}\,,
\end{equation}
with positive fusion weights $\omega_{k,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$, $1\leq i \leq m$, such that 
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^m\omega_{k,i}=1
\end{equation}
at each timestep $k$. In FCI, these weights are computed non-iteratively, as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fci_weights}
    \omega_{k,i} = \frac{1/\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}{\sum_{i=1}^m 1/\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Paillier Encryption Scheme}\label{subsec:paillier}
The Paillier encryption scheme \cite{paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999,katzIntroductionModernCryptography2008} is an additively homomorphic encryption scheme meeting the IND-CPA security notion. Key generation of the scheme is performed by choosing two sufficiently large primes of equal bit length, $p$ and $q$, and computing $N=pq$. The public key is defined by $\mathsf{pk} \triangleq N$ and the private key by $\mathsf{sk} \triangleq (p,q)$.

Encryption of a plaintext message $a \in \mathbb{Z}_N$, resulting in a ciphertext $\mathcal{E}_\mathsf{pk}(a) \in \mathbb{Z}^*_{N^2}$, is computed by
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E}_\mathsf{pk}(a) = (N+1)^a r^N \pmod{N^2}
\end{equation}
with a randomly chosen $r \in \mathbb{Z}_N$. Decryption of the ciphertext is computed by
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{D}_\mathsf{sk}(\mathcal{E}_\mathsf{pk}(a)) = \frac{L\left(\mathcal{E}_\mathsf{pk}(a)^\lambda \pmod{N^2}\right)}{L\left((N+1)^\lambda \pmod{N^2}\right)}\pmod{N}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda = \mathsf{lcm}(p-1,q-1)$ and $L(u)=\frac{u-1}{N}$. In addition to encryption and decryption, the following homomorphic properties are provided by the Paillier encryption scheme. $\forall a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{Z}_N$,
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}\label{eqn:paillier_add}
        \mathcal{D}_\mathsf{sk}(\mathcal{E}_\mathsf{pk}(a_1)\mathcal{E}_\mathsf{pk}(a_2) & \pmod{N^2})\\
        &= a_1+a_2 \pmod{N}\,,
    \end{split}\\
    \begin{split}\label{eqn:paillier_add_known}
        \mathcal{D}_\mathsf{sk}(\mathcal{E}_\mathsf{pk}(a_1)(N+1)^{a_2} & \pmod{N^2})\\
        &= a_1+a_2\pmod{N}\,,
    \end{split}\\
    \begin{split}
        \mathcal{D}_\mathsf{sk}(\mathcal{E}_\mathsf{pk}(a_1)^{a_2} & \pmod{N^2})\\
        &= a_1a_2 \pmod{N}\,.
    \end{split}
\end{align}

\subsection{Integer Encoding for Homomorphic Encryption}\label{subsec:encoding}
As the Paillier scheme bounds inputs to $a\in \mathbb{Z}_N$, multidimensional real-valued state estimates and error covariances require a suitable integer mapping to allow for their encryption and to preserve homomorphic operations. We achieve this with elementwise encoding and encryption, and rely on a generalised Q number encoding \cite{oberstarFixedPointRepresentationFractional2007}. Parametrised by a range $M\in \mathbb{N}$ and a fractional precision $\phi \in \mathbb{N}$, the encoding of a number $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathsf{E}_{M,\phi}(x) = \left\lfloor \phi x \right\rceil \pmod{M}\,,
\end{equation}
while decoding of an encoded number $u\in\mathbb{Z}_M$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathsf{E}^{-1}_{M,\phi}(u) =
    \begin{dcases}
        \frac{u \hspace{-8pt}\pmod{M}}{\phi}, &u \hspace{-8pt}\pmod{M} \leq \left\lfloor\frac{M}{2}\right\rfloor \\
        -\frac{M - u \hspace{-8pt}\pmod{M}}{\phi}, & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{dcases}.
\end{equation}
This encoding provides the homomorphic property
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:encoding_add}
    \begin{split}
        \mathsf{E}_{M,\phi}(a_1) + \mathsf{E}_{M,\phi}(a_2)& \pmod{M}\\
        &= \mathsf{E}_{M,\phi}(a_1+a_2)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
for $a_1,a_2\in\mathbb{R}$ when
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:encoding_overflow_req}
    \left|\phi(a_1+a_2)\right| < \left\lfloor \frac{M}{2} \right\rfloor\,.
\end{equation}
Here, we note that when $M=N$, \eqref{eqn:encoding_add} coincides with the Paillier homomorphic operations \eqref{eqn:paillier_add} and \eqref{eqn:paillier_add_known}, while when $N$ is very large ($N>2^{1024})$, \eqref{eqn:encoding_overflow_req} can generally be ignored.

\section{Encrypted Fast Covariance Intersection}\label{sec:encrypted_fci}
With the problem and preliminaries introduced, we can now present our encrypted FCI method that leaks no information to the fusing cloud. The core idea behind the method is to postpone the evaluation of operations that cannot be performed homomorphically until partial results are queried and decrypted by the key-holding third party. The remaining operations can then be evlaluated on unencrypted inputs to produce the correct results.

First, we note that the FCI fusion equations \eqref{eqn:ci_cov_fusion} and \eqref{eqn:ci_est_fusion} can be rearranged and substituted with weights \eqref{eqn:fci_weights} to obtain the equations
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fci_cov_rearrange}
    \mat{P}_{k,\mathsf{fus}} = \left(\left(\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}\right)^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}\mat{P}_{k,i}^{-1}\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fci_est_rearrange}
    \hat{\vec{x}}_{k,\mathsf{fus}} = \mat{P}_{k,\mathsf{fus}}\left(\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}\right)^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^m\frac{1}{\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}\mat{P}_{k,i}^{-1}\hat{\vec{x}}_{k,i}\,.
\end{equation}
In this form, innermost summations  
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}\,,\ \sum_{i=1}^m &\frac{1}{\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}\mat{P}_{k,i}^{-1}\text{ and }\\ 
        &\qquad\sum_{i=1}^m\frac{1}{\tr(\mat{P}_{k,i})}\mat{P}_{k,i}^{-1}\hat{\vec{x}}_{k,i}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
combine information from individual estimators $i$ and are computable homomorphically given suitable encryptions. Encryptions of these sums can then be decrypted by the key-holding third party, before remaining inversions and multiplications in \eqref{eqn:fci_cov_rearrange} and \eqref{eqn:fci_est_rearrange} can be computed to obtain the final results. To depict this process, pseudocode for the encryption at estimators, fusion at the cloud and decryption by the third party are provided in algorithms~\ref{alg:est_enc}, \ref{alg:cloud_fus} and \ref{alg:fus_query}, respectively.

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}[htbp]

    \Procedure{ObtainFusion}{$k$, $\mathsf{pk}$, $\mathsf{sk}$, $\phi$}

    \State \Return $\hat{\vec{x}}_{k,\mathsf{fus}}$, $\mat{P}_{k,\mathsf{fus}}$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Along with allowing the summations to be performed homomorphically on the cloud, we note that this form of the FCI also allows the cloud's partial fusion operations to be evaluated sequentially. This can be seen in algorithm~\ref{alg:cloud_fus}, where individual components $s_{k,i}$, $\mat{C}_{k,i}$ and $\vec{e}_{k,i}$ from each estimator can continue to be aggregated as additional estimators send their estimate information. This, in turn, supports the dynamic joining and leaving of estimators in the network without affecting the cloud or the querying third party operations.
